  Hi! I am Jithin Zacharia.
</div>

I’m a full stack developer at <a href="https://www.ust-global.com/">UST Global</a> . I recently completed my M.Sc in Computer Science and Information Secrity at <a href="https://www.iiitmk.ac.in/">IIITM-K</a> in India, where I studied Information Security and the process of developing secure software systems. Prior to that, I earned a B.Sc in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.b-u.ac.in/">Bharathiar University</a>, studying formal logic and fundamental Computer Science.

## Professional Experience

Since January 2017, I interned at <a href="https://www.ey.com/">Ernst & Young</a>, there I was responsible for writting `AngularJS` and `JavaScript` for an internal employee helpdesk application. Since July 2017, I interned at <a href="https://www.ust-global.com/">UST Global</a> where I got exposure to `NodeJS` and `Angular`. I developed applications for various clients.
During this time I workedon improving my JavaScript fluency, writing functional code, contributing to open-source projects, exploring CPython internals, visualizing data with libraries like D3, and making test-driven development a habit.

Since the March of 2018, I’ve been on the Innovation team at <a href="https://www.ust-global.com/">UST Global</a>, where I’m working on the design and implementation of various customer problems using Python and JavaScript.
